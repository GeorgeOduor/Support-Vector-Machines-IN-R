# Support Vector Machines IN R - Breast Cancer Relapse Prediction

# Introduction to the project.

This is Support Vector Machine implimentation with R language.It follow my previous post on [Understanding Support vector machines from 
scratch](https://github.com/GeorgeOduor/Support-Vector-Machines-IN-R/blob/master/support%20vector%20machines.ipynb) so incase you are not farmiliar with what SVMS are please check my post using that link.The project features exploratory data
analysis steps i have taken to understand the data better before fitting the model,model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning.

The project main objective is to classify breast cancer cells into a non recurrent event or recurrent.

For easy implementation you might concider reading **Support vector machine from scrath** in the link bellow.
